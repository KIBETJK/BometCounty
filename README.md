# BometCounty
This is my final year project.
It is a mobile application developed using React Native.
The application is a solution to limited market constraints of banana farmers in Bomet County.
It will act as a link between banana farmers in the county and accredited traders.
This will bolster the profits by cutting out the middlemen and thus improve farmer margins.
This will in turn lead to a greater uptake of banana farmeing in the county.
